# 🧠 Student Safety AI Dashboard

An end-to-end project using **Python (NLP & data simulation)** and **Power BI** to build a real-time, decision-support dashboard that identifies students at risk and recommends interventions.

Built to showcase skills in **data analytics, visualization, business insight generation**, and **interactive tool creation** — ideal for roles in **tech consulting**, **business analytics**, or **data strategy**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Many schools struggle with proactively identifying students who may need support — whether academically, behaviorally, or emotionally. This project simulates a solution by combining:

- 🎯 **Python-generated synthetic student data**
- 🔍 **Risk scoring & NLP sentiment analysis**
- 📊 **Interactive Power BI dashboard for decision-makers**
